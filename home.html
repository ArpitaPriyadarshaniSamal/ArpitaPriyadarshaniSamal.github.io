  I have always been keen for practical experiences. In my industrial training journey at SAIL, Rourkela and Aditya Aluminium &amp; Power Plant, Lapanga I could explore and gain experience on practical challenges at industry. 
    <br><br>
    During my Masters at IIT Jodhpur my project was based on thermodynamics calculation using Thermo-Calc software (CALPHAD approach) which was applied for Casting and Microstructure evolution prediction.
    <br><br>
    Further for my PhD in Metallurgical and Materials Engineering at IIT Madras, I delved to expand my research interest in Phase Field Modelling and Microstructure development via ICME Approach for Casting &amp; Solidification process of Aluminium alloys.
